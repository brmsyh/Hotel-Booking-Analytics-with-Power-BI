# Project Overview

This project simulates a freelance engagement in which I was hired by a hotel client to analyze booking demand, identify key performance challenges, and deliver a Power BI dashboard for management decision-making.

Using a dataset of 119,000+ hotel bookings, I performed exploratory data analysis, cancellation trend analysis, customer profiling, and room demand evaluation. The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides clear insights into booking behavior, market segments, seasonality, and customer retention.

This repository contains the analysis, documentation, and dashboard description.

# Project Context

As a Freelance Data Analyst, my role was to support the hotel’s Revenue Management and Marketing teams by transforming large-scale booking data into actionable intelligence.
The hotel faced challenges including rising cancellation rates, inconsistent demand patterns, and limited visibility into repeated guests and market segments.

The objective of the project was to provide clarity, identify performance bottlenecks, and guide strategic improvements across pricing, marketing, and operational planning.

# Problem Background

The hotel’s management team identified several critical business issues:

## 1. High Cancellation Rates

A significant portion of bookings were canceled, creating revenue uncertainty and making occupancy forecasting difficult. The hotel needed insight into when cancellations spike and which customer segments drive them.

## 2. Unstable Room Demand

Demand varied sharply by month, season, and weekday/weekend distribution. This hindered the hotel’s ability to plan inventory effectively, optimize staffing, set competitive pricing.

## 3. Limited Understanding of Repeated Guests

Repeated guests are valuable for long-term revenue, but the hotel lacked clarity on where they come from, how they behave, and also their cancellation tendencies.

## 4. Lack of Visual Analytics

Operational decisions were based heavily on spreadsheets, limiting the ability to explore the data interactively or uncover deeper insights.

# Project Objectives

This project was designed to deliver:

## 1. Cancellation Analysis

- Measure cancellation volume and rate.

- Identify high-cancellation months.

- Compare cancellation behavior across market segments (Online TA, Groups, Offline TA/TO, Direct).

## 2. Demand and Seasonality Analysis

- Compare weekday vs weekend stays.

- Evaluate room type demand stability.

- Detect seasonal booking patterns.

## 3. Customer Insights

- Identify repeated guests and their geographic distribution.

- Analyze demand by country.

- Understand booking behaviors across customer types.

## 4. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive visualization tool enabling the hotel to monitor KPIs in real time explore booking and cancellation patterns, and make informed decisions using data-driven insights.

# Key Findings & Insights

## 1. Summer Months Show the Highest Cancellation Rates

August recorded the most cancellations (5.2K), followed by July and May. These months may require pricing adjustments or stricter policy enforcement.

## 2. Online Travel Agencies Contribute Nearly Half of All Cancellations

Online TA accounts for 48% of total cancellations. This segment is high-volume but unstable.

## 3. Weekday Stays Outperform Weekend Stays

Weekday bookings remain consistently higher throughout the year. Weekend demand fluctuates more and may require targeted promotions.

## 4. Portugal Produces the Most Repeated Guests

Over 49,000 repeated guests originate from Portugal. Indicates strong loyalty or geographical proximity.

## 5. Room Type A Shows the Most Stable Demand

Room Type A represents  approximately 69% of overall demand. Other room types experience significantly more volatility.

#Business Recommendations

## 1. Strengthen Cancellation Controls for Online Travel Agencies

- Consider stricter cancellation policies.

- Promote partially/non-refundable options.

- Work with OTA partners to minimize speculative bookings.

## 2. Apply Seasonal Pricing and Overbooking Strategies

- Adjust pricing during high-cancellation months.

- Use predictive models to optimize overbooking levels.

- Offer incentives for early confirmation or prepayment.

## 3. Optimize Room Type Inventory

- Expand availability of high-demand Room Type A.

- Develop upsell strategies for lower-demand room types.

- Regularly review inventory mix to maximize revenue.

## 4. Target High-Value Countries With Loyalty Campaigns

- Strengthen promotions aimed at the Portuguese market.

- Leverage loyalty programs to increase return visits.

- Explore growth opportunities in UK, France, and Spain.

## 5. Improve Weekend Occupancy Through Promotions

- Introduce weekend packages (family, staycation, holiday themes).

- Adjust pricing dynamically based on expected demand.

## 6. Build Predictive Models for Demand and Cancellations

- Implement machine learning models for cancellation prediction, occupancy forecasting, and seasonal booking trends.

- Integrate predictions into pricing and inventory decisions.
